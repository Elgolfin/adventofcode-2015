## Day01 Solution

Nothing special except I should have put the input string in a file.

## Day02 Solution

I should have put the input string in a file.

I created a **Box** class which handles all the needed calculations for the:
- wrapping paper (in square feet)
- ribbon (in feet)

## Day03 Solution

Once again, I should have put the input string in a file. :p

I created a **HousesGrid** object which handles the positions of both Santa and RoboSanta in the grid. It also handles who should move during each turn.
You can specify at the instanciation of the grid if you would like to use RoboSanta or not.

## Day04 Solution

Nothing special. Pretty straight forward.

## Day05 Solution

I used two Regex to detect if a string:
- does contain a letter twice in a row
- does contain one letter which repeats with exactly one letter between them

I also used a custom method to handle if a string does contain any pair of two letters appearing twice without overlapping. Not really sure if we can do that with a Regex (I will do some further research).

I leveraged the [Extension Methods] of the C# framework.

##Day10 Solution

##Day11 Solution

##Day12 Solution

## Day21 Solution

## Day21 Solution

- No TDD = No Unit Tests (to be added)
- Refactoring needed
